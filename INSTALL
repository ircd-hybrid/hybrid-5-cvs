HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses gnu autoconf instead of the old
Config script.  The Makefile has also been updated to include CFLAGS
defines for popular modern OSes.

0.  Read the README.hybrid file to find out about the cool new
stuff in this version.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will setup include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

2.  Edit the top level Makefile.  You WILL need to modify the CFLAGS.

3.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
various options of how the ircd will operate.  Notes: "HARD_FDLIMIT_"
and "INIT_MAXCLIENTS" must be less than the maximum file descriptors
per process allowed by your kernel, and must be <= FD_SETSIZE (usually
defined in system includes, but may need to overridden in the Makefile.
Note that the old OS definitions are gone, autoconf handles this now.
Finally set the various PATH's to where you are going to stick this stuff.

N.B. for linux
in include/setup.h
you probably will find NBLOCK_POSIX to work better than the
one configure picks. 

/* Chose only one of NBLOCK_POSIX, NBLOCK_BSD, and NBLOCK_SYSV */
/* Define if you have posix non-blocking sockets (O_NONBLOCK) */
#define NBLOCK_POSIX 1

4.  "make" should build ircd.

5.  "make install" should sorta work now.


HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
Send Check or Money Order to...  just kidding!  You're on your own for
support.  Try asking other ircd-hybrid admins on EFnet if you can't fix
it yourself.  You can also try on #ircd on EFnet.
If you do fix anything, however, please send context
diffs to ircd-hybrid@the-project.org so the fixes can be incorporated into
the next release of ircd-hybrid.  If hybrid crashes on you, PLEASE CONTACT
ircd-hybrid@the-project.org ASAP with a backtrace of the core.  The hybrid team
can't fix bugs if no one tells us about them!
